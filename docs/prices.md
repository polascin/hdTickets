Prices for sports event ticket purchasing, monitoring, and scraping services vary a lot depending on scope, legality, and the provider. Here’s a practical breakdown to give you a ballpark understanding. Note: scraping and automated ticket purchase can breach terms of service for many sites and may be illegal in some jurisdictions; always verify compliance and consider using official APIs or partnerships whenever possible.

1) Ticket purchasing/monitoring services (solo browser automation or bot-like tools)
- Small-time monitors (manual alerts + basic monitoring):
  - Price range: $10–$50 per month
  - Features: email or SMS alerts when tickets appear, basic price tracking, simple web monitoring
- Automated purchasing/booking assistance (non-anti-bot-evading):
  - Price range: $50–$200 per month
  - Features: automated retries, queue handling, checkout automation on allowed sites, basic analytics
- Full-service ticket brokering or dynamic purchasing:
  - Price range: $200–$1,000+ per month (or higher for enterprise)
  - Features: multi-site monitoring, automatic carting/purchasing, dynamic price optimization, faster execution, risk management, human-in-the-loop support

2) Scraping services (data collection from ticketing sites)
- Basic data scraping (one or few sites, straightforward HTML):
  - Price range: $20–$200 per month
  - Features: price history, event calendars, seat maps, CSV/JSON export
- Multi-site scraping with scheduling and alerts:
  - Price range: $200–$1,000+ per month
  - Features: scraper farms, rotating proxies, IP management, API access, dashboards, data normalization
- Enterprise-scale scraping (high volume, many sites, robust anti-bot handling):
  - Price range: $1,000–$10,000+ per month
  - Features: dedicated proxies, headless browser orchestration, SLA, compliance tooling, custom data models

3) One-time or project-based pricing
- One-time data extraction (e.g., historical price data, seat maps):
  - Range: $500–$5,000+, depending on scope and data quality
- Custom automation scripts or integrations:
  - Range: $1,000–$20,000+, depending on complexity, sites targeted, reliability requirements

4) Compliance, legality, and risk considerations
- Many ticketing sites implement anti-bot measures; automation can violate terms of service and trigger account suspensions or legal action.
- Public or official APIs (if available) are usually the safer route; look for partnerships or data licensing.
- If you’re building a tool for legitimate purposes (e.g., accessibility needs, official resale with consent), discuss with the site for permissible use and potential API access.

5) How to choose a price point
- Scope of needs: monitoring frequency (real-time vs hourly), number of sites, and required data depth
- Reliability and speed: paid plans typically offer higher uptime, faster responses, and support
- Compliance risk tolerance: prefer providers with clear legal compliance and data usage policies
- Budget vs value: balance monthly/annual costs against potential gains (e.g., early access to high-demand tickets)

6) Quick tips
- Start with a pilot: test a basic monitoring/alert service for a few events before scaling.
- Favor official channels: look for official APIs or partner programs to minimize risk.
- Ask for demos and SLAs: understand uptime, support response times, and data accuracy guarantees.
- Watch for hidden costs: add-ons like proxies, higher concurrency, or API rate limits can increase total price.

If you share more specifics (e.g., number of sites, target events, desired alert latency, whether you need data export/API access, and your budget), I can tailor a more precise price landscape and even suggest a shortlist of providers or configuration options.
