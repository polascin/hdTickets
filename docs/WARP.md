# WARP.md (Redirect)

**Note**: The canonical WARP.md file has been moved to the repository root to consolidate conflicting instructions and serve as the single source of truth.

Please refer to **[../WARP.md](../WARP.md)** for up-to-date guidance when working with this repository.

This consolidation ensures consistent toolchain documentation (particularly the requirement to use Pest, not PHPUnit) and eliminates version conflicts between different documentation files.
