Based on the code review, I found the default passwords used in the HD Tickets application. Here are the key findings:

Default User Credentials

From the UserSeeder.php file, these are the test/development accounts with their passwords:

Admin Accounts:
1. Root Admin (ticketmaster)
•  Username: ticketmaster
•  Email: ticketmaster@hdtickets.admin
•  Password: SecureAdminPass123!
2. Admin User
•  Username: admin.user
•  Email: admin@hdtickets.com
•  Password: password

Agent Accounts:
1. Agent User
•  Username: agent.user
•  Email: agent@hdtickets.com
•  Password: password
2. John Agent
•  Username: john.agent
•  Email: john.agent@hdtickets.com
•  Password: password

Customer Accounts:
1. Customer User
•  Username: customer.user
•  Email: customer@hdtickets.com
•  Password: password
2. Jane Customer
•  Username: jane.customer
•  Email: jane.customer@hdtickets.com
•  Password: password

Additional Accounts from DatabaseFixerSeeder:

•  System Administrator
•  Email: admin@hdtickets.com
•  Password: admin123
•  Support Agent
•  Email: agent@hdtickets.com
•  Password: agent123

Important Notes:

1. Security Warning: These are obviously development/test passwords and should never be used in production.
2. Factory Users: The seeder also creates 1000+ additional fake users via User::factory()->count(1000)->create(), but these would have random passwords generated by the factory.
3. Root Admin Creation: There's also a console command hdtickets:create-root-admin that can create a root admin with custom credentials.

You can try logging in with any of these accounts to test the dropdown functionality. I'd recommend starting with:
•  Email: admin@hdtickets.com / Password: password
•  Email: ticketmaster@hdtickets.admin / Password: SecureAdminPass123!

Would you like me to help you test the dropdown menus with one of these accounts, or do you need assistance with anything else regarding the authentication system?
